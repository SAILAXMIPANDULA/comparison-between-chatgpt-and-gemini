Mental Health Detection Using Large Language Models
Introduction and Statement of Problem
Mental health is a critical concern affecting millions worldwide. Depression, stress, anxiety, and other mental health disorders are prevalent due to modern lifestyles and societal pressures. Traditional methods of mental health consultation involve face-to-face interactions with professionals, which can be challenging in todayâ€™s busy world. There is a need for accessible and private ways to monitor mental health. This project aims to create a model that generates accurate responses to mental health-related questions using AI. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini, this project seeks to provide support for individuals dealing with mental health issues.

Objectives of the Study
The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT and Gemini, in recognizing and understanding mental health concerns in text-based communication. The objectives include:

Analysis of Linguistic Features: Investigate linguistic characteristics such as syntactic, semantic, and discourse patterns associated with mental health problems.
Performance Evaluation: Determine the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT and Gemini in recognizing and responding to language patterns indicative of mental health issues.
Comparing Embeddings: Compare the embeddings generated by ChatGPT and Gemini with those from a ground truth set to evaluate coherence with real-world data.
Benchmarking and Cosine Similarity: Assess the accuracy of ChatGPT and Gemini using a cosine similarity score as a quantitative measure of their ability to detect mental health-related language.
Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs in detecting mental health issues, including privacy, data security, bias, and informed consent.
Research Design
The research design consists of several steps:

Data Collection: The "mental-health-conversational-data" dataset from Hugging Face is used, containing discussions between therapists/doctors and patients about mental health.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, converted into a data frame, and cleaned by removing null values, empty strings, and "None" values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights are derived using word clouds and value counts to understand conversation characteristics.
Response Generation: ChatGPT and Gemini are used to generate responses to each context in the dataset.
Embedding Conversion: Responses are converted into numerical embeddings using BERT.
Cosine Similarity Score: The embeddings are compared using cosine similarity to quantify the similarity between vectors.
Data Collection
The dataset contains 661 rows and three columns: context, knowledge, and response. It provides insights into mental health support through interactions with doctors/therapists.

Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA helps in understanding the dataset and conversation characteristics. Word clouds visualize the most frequently used words, and value counts analyze the unique categories in the "Knowledge" column.

Hypotheses
The hypothesis is that ChatGPT will perform better than Gemini in generating responses related to mental health conversations. This will be tested by comparing cosine similarity scores between the original responses and those generated by ChatGPT and Gemini.

Model Analysis and Exploration
The project involves generating responses using ChatGPT and Gemini, converting these responses into embeddings using BERT, and comparing them with standard embeddings using cosine similarity.

Results
Cosine Similarity Score: ChatGPT achieved a cosine similarity score of 93%, while Gemini scored 88%.
Data Visualization: Scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps are used to visualize the similarities and differences between the embeddings.
Conclusion
The study found that ChatGPT outperforms Gemini in identifying patterns and linguistic features associated with mental health issues. ChatGPT's high accuracy and consistency make it a reliable tool for mental health support systems. However, further studies are required to address ethical considerations and broader applications.
